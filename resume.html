  <h2> About Me </h2>
I’m a current sophomore at the University of Maryland pursuing a dual degree in journalism and government and politics with a concentration in international relations. I’m interested in visual journalism and digital content creation—specifically information graphics and data visualization—centered on domestic and international politics and policy. I’m also passionate about modern education policy and education reform in the United States. I’m involved in the Global Fellows in Washington, D.C. program and previously UMD’s First-Year Innovation and Research Experience, and am currently the Communications Intern at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW).
